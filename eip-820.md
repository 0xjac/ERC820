## Preamble

    EIP: 820
    Title: Pseudo-introspection using a registry contract.
    Author: Jordi Baylina @jbaylina
    Type: StandardTrack
    Category: ERC
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2018-01-05


## Simple Summary
This standard defines a universal registry smart contract where each contract or regular account can register which interfaces they implement and which smart contract is responsable for such implementation.

## Abstract
This standard pretends to define a way where smart contracts and regular accounts can publish which functionalities they implement.

The rest of the world can query this smart contract to ask if a speficic address implements a given interface and which smart contract handles such implementation.

This smart contract can be deployed in any chain and will share the exact same address.

## Motivation

There has been different approaches to define the pseudo-introspection in the Ethereum. The first is EIP-165 which has the problem that it is not extendable to regular accounts. The second approach was EIP-672 which uses reverseENS. Using reverseENS, have two important issues: the rest is that it's too complex, and the second and mos important is that ENS is still a centralized contract controlled by a multisig.  This multisig, theorically would be able to modify the system.

This standard is much more simple than EIP672 and it is absolutely decentralized.

This standard also solves the problem of having diferent addresses for diferent chains.

## Specification

### The smart contract

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract InterfaceImplementationRegistry {

    mapping (address => mapping(bytes32 => address)) interfaces;
    mapping (address => address) public managers;

    modifier canManage(address addr) {
        require(msg.sender == addr || msg.sender == managers[addr]);
        _;
    }

    function interfaceHash(string interfaceName) public pure returns(bytes32) {
        return keccak256(interfaceName);
    }


    /// @notice query if an address implements an interface and thru which contract
    /// @param addr Address that wants to be queried for the implementation of an interface
    /// @param iHash SHA3 of the string of the name of the interface.
    ///  Example `web3.utils.sha3('Ierc777`')`
    /// @return The address of the contract that implements a spefici interface
    ///  or 0x0 if `addr` does not implement this interface
    function getInterfaceImplementer(address addr, bytes32 iHash) public constant returns (address) {
        return interfaces[addr][iHash];
    }

    /// @notice Sets the contract that will handle a specific interface.
    ///  only the address or a `manager` defined for that addresss can set it.
    /// @param addr Address that you want to define the interface for.
    /// @param iHash SHA3 of the string of the name of the interface.
    ///  Example `web3.utils.sha3('Ierc777`')`
    function setInterfaceImplementer(address addr, bytes32 iHash, address implementer) public canManage(addr)  {
        interfaces[addr][iHash] = implementer;
        InterfaceImplementerSet(addr, iHash, implementer);
    }

    /// @notice Sets an external `manager` that will be able to call `setInterfaceImplementer()`
    ///  in behalf of the address.
    /// @param addr Address that you want to define the manager for.
    /// @param newManager The address of the manager for the `addr` that will replace
    ///  the old one.  Set to 0x0 if you want to remove the manager.
    function changeManager(address addr, address newManager) public canManage(addr) {
        managers[addr] = newManager;
        ManagerChanged(addr, newManager);
    }

    event InterfaceImplementerSet(address indexed addr, bytes32 indexed interfaceHash, address indexed implementer);
    event ManagerChanged(address indexed addr, address indexed newManager);
}
```

```

You can see the all `a` at the end. This is the `s` of the signature, meaning that's a a deterministic by hand forced signature.

### Special deployer account.

```
0xda9dab8574df7e980f45761aedc2ecdc0f6d6cb3
```

This account is generated in a way that no body knows their private key, but it's known that it's a valid signer of the deployment transaction.

### Deployment method.

The way to deploy this contract is by sending ETH to the deployer account and then broadcast the transaction.


### Deployed contract.
```
0x4205cef72ce73fc282075dc64d9e290a75bd9590
```

The contract will always have this address what ever chain is deployed.
